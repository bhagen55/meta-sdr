# meta-sdr
Yocto layers for software-defined radios.

These layers are intended to get [OpenWebRX+](https://fms.komkon.org/OWRX/) contained in `meta-sdr/recipes-sdr/openwebrx-plus` running on a Raspberry Pi 4.
I did my best with the structuring of the main package and it's dependencies, but I am not a Yocto expert so your results may vary.
